# Library Management System

This project is a simple, console-based Library Management System implemented in Java. It allows users to manage a collection of books by adding, borrowing, and returning them. The system is designed to run in a console environment and provides an intuitive interface for performing book-related operations. This project is a great way to demonstrate basic object-oriented programming concepts and control structures.

## Features

- **Add a Book**: Store details about new books, including the title, author, and year of publication.
- **Display Books**: View all the available books in the library.
- **Borrow a Book**: Borrow a book by its title, removing it from the available collection.
- **Return a Book**: Return a borrowed book to the library by providing the title, author, and year of publication.
- **Exit**: Exit the system gracefully, ensuring that all resources are properly closed.
